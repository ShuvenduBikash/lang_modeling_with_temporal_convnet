# Sequence Modeling Benchmarks and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN)


This repository contains the experiments done in the work "Improving Bangla language modeling with temporal convolutional network"

Experiments are done in PyTorch. The code is intensively borrowed from [TCN](http://github.com/locuslab/TCN)



## Domains and Datasets
For Bangla language modeling I colleted wikidumb data and processed it to get cleaned Bangla text of around 350Mb and used it for this experiment
